        <p>From a young age, I've always had a passion for design. I spent my childhood sketching, drawing, and getting lost in my imaginative creations. Cars, in particular, fascinated me. Iâ€™m also a car guy, in my free time, I loved to redesign car exteriors, interiors, and especially digital gauges. I always aimed to design them in a way that aligns with my vision of an ideal automobile brand.</p>
        <p>In college, I shifted from a design major to business administration due to financial constraints. Later, I co-founded a clothing brand with friends, taking charge of design, from our site to the clothes, and photo edits. Despite the challenges, it emphasized my true passion for design. While I earned good money as an agent and salesman, my heart always gravitated towards design. Now, I'm chasing my real dream.</p>
